# Nextcloud Teams
[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/nextcloud/circles)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/nextcloud/circles)

### Bring cloud-users closer together

Nextcloud Teams allow people to create their own groups of people/colleagues/friends.
Those groups of people can then be used by any other app for sharing purpose.

The app was formerly named circles which is still used as internal identifier a lot.


# Installation
The *Teams* app is installed and enabled by default.

# Documentation
You can use the `\Psr\Container\ContainerInterface`, see [dependency injection](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/stable/developer_manual/basics/dependency_injection.html), to get the `\OCA\Circles\CireclesManager` class, see our [API documentation](https://nextcloud.github.io/circles/) for its interface.
